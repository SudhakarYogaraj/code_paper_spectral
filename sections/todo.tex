\section*{To Do list}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rewrite the Matlab code in C++.
    \item Compare the computational cost of both methods. (In the case of SPDEs, the spectral method is exact. Comparison?)
    \item Hypotheses to ensure weak convergence + homogenization result, using~\cite{pardoux2001poisson}.
    \item Finish the proof of weak convergence
\end{itemize}
