    This paper presents a new method  for the solution of multiscale stochastic
    equations at the diffusive time scale, based on a Hermite spectral method.
    The method is based on the solution of a Poisson equation at each time
    step, which is used to approximate the effective drift and diffusion
    coefficients of the slow process.  We present the method for multiscale
    finite dimensional systems of SDEs at first, and later show how it can be
    applied to multiscale SPDEs. Numerical experiments are presented, as well
    as a comparison with the heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) in terms of
    computational cost.
